# Arduino_Self_Parking_Robot
 A line-following robot with the ability to scan parking spaces and locate a free spot for parking, employing IR sensors and one ultrasonic sensor. The IR sensors will be used by the robot to navigate as it follows a black line. It must maintain track of the junctions and only scan the parking spaces at the odd intersections to find those that are occupied. The robot will pull into the first spot that opens before indicating how many occupied spaces it found on the way. The goal of this project is to create a line-following robot that can successfully move along a specified course and find open parking spaces, offering a novel solution for the autonomous vehicle industry.
